#The following prints Hello, checks if 2 is greater than 1 and then breaks. Therefore hi is not printed.
#please replace break with something so that both Hello and Hi is printed repeatedly

while True:
    print("Hello")
    if 2 > 1:
        #break
       pass
    print("Hi")


#pass allows to move on to next statement
